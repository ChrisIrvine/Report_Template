Holds a LaTeX template and a class file for writing academic reports. Files have additionally been compressed into a .zip folder

## Acknowledgements
This .cls file is adapted from a .cls file made by Dan Smith of UEA that was extensively used during my 3rd year of University. Changes were implemented by Jack Penson (my coursemate at UEA) and later myself.
